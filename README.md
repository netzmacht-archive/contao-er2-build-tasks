Contao ER2 build tasks for phing
============

This library provides two build tasks which can be used to build Contao extensions for the ER2.

The building process was created by Tristan Lins [bit3/contao-er2-builder](https://github.com/bit3/contao-er2-builder).
This is a fork of his great work to integrate it in a phing build process.
